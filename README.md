# Rickshell
Welcome to `rickshell`, a shell developed in C, inspired by and named after @rickroot30 (Kim Hyunseo). This project is a successor to the original `rickshell`, a private project crafted in Python by rickroot30, and aims to extend its legacy through the power of C programming.

## Overview
`Rickshell` is designed as a lightweight, yet powerful shell for interacting with the Unix/Linux operating system. It encapsulates the essence of command-line navigation, program execution, and provides a foundation for further expansion and customization.

## Features

- **Successor to Python `rickshell`**: Inherits the spirit and core functionalities from the original project, reimagined in C for enhanced performance and closer system integration.
- **Development Stage**: Please note that `rickshell` is currently in an early stage of development. Security has not been the primary focus at this point, and users are advised to use it in safe and controlled environments.

## Prerequisites
Before you embark on your journey with `rickshell`, there are a couple of prerequisites to ensure a smooth setup:

- **Readline Library**: `Rickshell` leverages the GNU Readline library to handle input efficiently, offering features like command line editing and history. Make sure to install the Readline library on your system.
- **Make**: The project uses `make` for building and compiling, streamlining the installation process. Ensure that you have `make` installed on your system.

## Installation

To install `rickshell`, follow these simple steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the cloned directory.
3. Run `make` to compile the sources.
4. Execute `./build/rickshell` to launch the shell.

## Contribution

`Rickshell` is an open project, and contributions are warmly welcomed. Whether it's through submitting bug reports, offering new ideas, or contributing code, your input is invaluable in making `rickshell` a better tool for everyone.

## Acknowledgements

Special thanks to @rickroot30 (Kim Hyunseo), whose original vision and project laid the groundwork for `rickshell`. This project is a testament to the power of open-source collaboration and the endless possibilities that come with it.

Join us in shaping the future of `rickshell` and enjoy the journey through the vast landscape of Unix/Linux systems.
